# CSE4/589: Modern Network Concepts - Programming Assignment 1

Welcome to Programming Assignment 1 for CSE4/589: Modern Network Concepts, focused on developing a text chat application. This assignment involves building both client and server components to enable text communication over TCP connections. Follow the guidelines below to start your project.

## Objectives

The main goal is to develop a text chat application comprising one chat server and multiple chat clients, facilitating communication over TCP connections. The project is divided into two stages:

- **Stage 1:** Implement basic login functionality for the client and server applications.
- **Stage 2:** Implement advanced features based on Stage 1, enhancing the application's capabilities.

## Getting Started

You have the option to complete this assignment in either C or C++. To select your language of choice, execute the following command in your terminal. This will merge the chosen language branch into the main branch of your repository.

For C:
```
cd <path_to_your_local_repo>
git fetch --all
git merge origin/c -m "lang option: c" --no-ff && git push origin main
```

For C++:
```
cd <path_to_your_local_repo>
git fetch --all
git merge origin/cpp -m "lang option: cpp" --no-ff && git push origin main
```

## Directory Structure

After merging the chosen branch, your directory should follow the structure outlined below:

### For C:
